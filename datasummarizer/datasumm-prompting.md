Could you write an app in a single web page (HTML file + javascript) that does the following: 1) reads a delimited-text source; 2) lets the user choose a field of the data set to summarize; if the field is numeric, allow the user to specify either a number of bins or size of bins for summarizing the data in a histogram; 3) presents a summary of the field as a bar chart with number of occurrences of each unique value for string data, or number of occurrences of data for each bin of numeric data.

Please modify this to allow the user either to upload a delimited text file, or supply a URL for a delimited text data source. The app should allow the user to choose from a list of comma (','), tab, or pipe ('|') as delimiters, with pipe being the default choice.

Excellent! Now add options allowing the user to choose (1) sort the data either by data value, or by count of occurrences, and (2) sort ascending or sort descending.
Also -- in choosing the source for delimited-text data, make choose from a local file the default choice.

Great! Could you add an option to omit empty values from the histogram?
