I would like to create a web app using the IIIF protocol to display an image.The IIIF viewer should be built from scratch rather than using a library like OpenSeaDragon.

The app should have 2 modes of interaction: 1) pan and zoom the image; 2) draw a rectangle on it. The webapp should use HTML, CSS and Javascript, and be packaged in a single html file. Use this as the default value for a IIIF info request on an image: http://www.homermultitext.org/iipsrv?IIIF=/project/homer/pyramidal/deepzoom/hmt/vaimg/2017a/VA012RN_0013.tif/info.json

Exercise special care not to redefine global variables recording data about the user-drawn rectanges. Use anonymous CORS to avoid restrictions on cross-origin access.

On initially loading an image, the entire image should be displayed to the user.

The user-defined rectangles should highlight the same area of the image when the user pans and zooms.

The app should capture the coordinates of each rectangle, and display them to the user in percentage terms as a percent of the whole image, scaled from 0.0 to 1.0.
  
Each time the user draws a rectangle, The app should copy the entire list of rectangle coordinates to the user's clipboard, one rectangle per line, with the four values separated by commas.

In highlighting rectangles on the image, please omit the border on the rectangle, and use the same opacity for the entire rectangle. Please rotate through a palette of different colors as you highlight each rectangle.

The app should offer an option to clear all rectangles. This should remove the rectangles from the display highlights and empty out the saved list of coordinates.
